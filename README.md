# pierce 2.0

pierce 2.0 is a split modular wireless / semi-wireless 3x5+3 column staggered keyboard. The design is inspired by [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) 
with more pinky stagger as well as only using 1u keycaps.
It is possible to build a wireless version or a semi wireless version. If building the wireless version an additional reciever dongle is required. 
In the semi wireless version the wired half is also acting as a reciever for the wireless half. 
Both versions have full QMK support.  
Supported switches: MX, Choc V1, Alps

The semi wireless version has built in trackpoint support (a few extra components required).

There are 3 different PCBs: wireless (reversible), wired (right) and reciever.

PCBs needed:  
Wireless version: 2x wireless, 1x reciever  
Semi wireless version: 1x wireless, 1x wired
